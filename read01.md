## What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort intelligence and talent are simply good starting points 
A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.


> Hereâ€™s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a *fixed* and a *growth* mindset:

> Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset:

1. Challenges 
2. Obstacles
3. Effort
4. Criticism
5. Success of others



> from my opinon about a growth midset:

1. I think that is no one have zero  problems 
But there are two types of people
Kind who faces this problem and is determined to solve the problem
The other type did not face its problems

2. i think if we had a Challenges a Obstacles
we must face it and be strong and be strigule 
to get Success

3. I think that we should always nourish our mind with positive things
