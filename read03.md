# This section discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website.

> Who is the Site For?

Every website should be designed for the
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is.

> Why People Visit YOUR Website

Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

> What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs. 

> What Information Your Visitors Need 

You know who is coming to your site and why
they are coming, so now you need to work out
what information they need in order to achieve
their goals quickly and effectively. 

> How Often People Will Visit Your Site

Some sites benefit from being updated more
frequently than others. Some information (such
as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.

> Site Maps

Now that you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages.

> WireFrames :

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.


# HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.


> Traditional HTML Layouts 

For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.


> New Html5 Layout Elements

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

- Headers & Footers
- Navigation 
- Articles 
- asides
- Sections
