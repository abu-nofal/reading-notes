# how the computer works :

so whether you're just curious about the devices you see every day the first step is learning how computers work 

1. what makes a computer computer
2. who the information is represnted iside the computer
3. sho computer use circuits to do every thing 
4. different parts of computer 
   . input 
   . store 
   . prosces 
   . output 

5. what code actually is and how software controls hardware

> whats makes a computer a computer anyway 

as the pioneers of computer science explored how to design 
athinking machine the realized that it had to perform four differnt 
- take input 
- store information
- prosces
- output the result 

these for things common at all computers 

> input 

is the stuff that the world does or that you do 
that makes the computer do stuff and takes that as input 
on what its doing 

> store

all of these different inputs give a computer information
which is the stored in the memory

> prosces

the computer doing the proscesfor the input and send thim to store thin send thim to out put after prosces

> output

show the result to us as img video songs sound etc ..


## BIT 
the on off state of a single wire and its the smallest piece of information a computer can store .

## BINARY NUMBER 

what's important is that any number can be represent with only ones and zeros or by a bunch of wires that are on or off the more wires we use the larger the number you can store 

so if you want to understand how computer work on the iside it all comes down these sample ones and zeros and the electrical signls in the circuits behinde them .

## CPU 

central processing unit calculates information
the cpu calculet how to display the letter pixel by pixel
the cpu request step by step instrouction from memory
which tell it how to drow the letter the cpu runs these instrouction and stores the results as pixel in memory
finally , this pixel informationis sent in binary is an output device .
which converts the binary singals into the tiny lights and cobrs that make up what you see 

## hardware

when you look iside a computing device you see a banch of circuits , chips ,wires speakers and all sorts of other stuff 

## software

is all computer programe code , runing on the machine 
and software could be website or video game app etc ..
and we use a differnt langues to build our stuff .
